# final-project

For my Portfolio, I wanted to make something that showed my capabilities not only in design but in coding as well. I challenged myself to try a different layout than the ones I worked on before in other assignments. I also wanted to show my way of thinking and design, rather than putting only images of previous work in a simplistic way, I wanted to play with the design to show throughout the page my design skills.

I think this website is the reflection of who I am as a designer, as the main concept states, It's bold, unique, but also professional. It showcases diverse projects that I can approach as a graphic, media, and product designer.
